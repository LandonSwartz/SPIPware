Landon's To do for SPIPware, sarcasm slightly used:

Goals:
1. Get 2D program working with plates, well, trays
2. Make GUI for experiment builder
3. Make variabled
4. Extreme Code Makeover (documentation, github page, removing legacy code)

1. Backend (Biggest Hurdles):
	- Finish plate, well, and tray classes DONE (at least arbitarialy)
		- Basic framework set up DONE
		- Make more variabled with 2D Arraylist/list to make size dynamic based on user settings
		- Add more methods to make finding where well is on plate for GRBL automatic
	- Rebuild machine.cs to take plate, well and trays and maybe make more variable DONE
		- Added property named trays that is an array of 3 trays (for time being)
			- Add way to make variabled
	- Redo CycleControl.cs to take plates, well, and trays in motion DONE
		- Remaking front end components that are also affected by this (maybe just leave to redo in future)
	- (Optional) Make PheripheralControl.cs take many cameras 
	- Make Experiment.cs a better object for the plates, trays, and wells
		- Maybe just remake entire experiment object because need to gut a lot of past things
		- Make the object compatible with JSON file type
	- Make file reader for importing plate config and other things
		- Saving plate configs in experiment builder
		- Already have default so user can't mess it up then maybe make it later
	
2. Frontend:
	- Make Experiment builder window
	- Remake the parts of main window to remove old experiment things and input the new
		- Move timelaspe ribbon to experiment builder window
		- Move parts of Machine tab to window
		- Move experiment tab to window
		- Add y position to g-code terminal view
	
	- (Optional) Update Sunbear logo to BugBear logo
	
3. Other Goals
	-Documenation
		- Documenting back end code
			- xml to every function and class
		- Documenting front end code
			- xml to major parts of GUI
			- reformat GUI files to be more intuitative in reading
	- Quality of Life improvements
		- Asking to close window if trying to close during cycle
		- General Code Clean up
			- Remove legacy code from CNC mill
			- Remove past comments
			- Add regions to major parts of classes DONE
			- Rework files
		- Settings Window
			- (Optional) Make Settings window and import some of settings of application (because y and z axis can be enable/disabled in settings and maybe way to switch between one and two axis)
			- Add to file ribbon on ribbbon bar
			- Useful for dev testing at least
		- Github Update
			- Update ReadMe
				- Add images, some experiment data, way more info on program and everything else
				- Documenation doc on page
				- Move over to lab github
				- Add contribute.md file
