To do for SPIPware:

Backend (Biggest Hurdles):
	- Finish plate, well, and tray classes DONE (at least arbitarialy)
	- Rebuild machine.cs to take plate, well and trays and maybe make more variable
	- Redo CycleControl.cs to take plates, well, and trays in motion
	- (Optional) Make PheripheralControl.cs take many cameras 
	- Make Experiment.cs a better object for the plates, trays, and wells
	- Make file reader for importing plate config and other things
	
Frontend:
	- Make Experiment builder window
	- Remake the parts of main window to remove old experiment things and input the new
	- (Optional) Make Settings window and import some of settings of application (because y and z axis can be enable/disabled in settings and maybe way to switch between one and two axis)
	- (Optional) Update Sunbear logo to BugBear logo
	
Other Wants (but not needs)
	- Documenting back end code
	- Documenting front end code
	- Quality of Life improvements
