Experiment Builder:

GOAL: To build 'experiments' in SPIPware and greatly expand the experiment function by making it variable

Steps:
1. Make classes for steps of experiment

Experiment
|
|--Machine
|	|
|	|--Plate (collection of wells)
|	|	|
|	|	|--Wells (individual thing of being experimented
|	|	|


Wells will need radius and other attributes
Plates will need number of wells and arrangement
Machine will be a camera and number of plates
Expriment will need number of total plates and positioning and  number of machines/cameras connected

2. Make pop-up window of experiment builder
	- Want to make it savabale and reusable
	- variable
	- etc.
	
3. Implement and test

Notes over existing program:
Experiment.cs saves the infomation of the experiment so that can be saved and extended through experiment
builder 

cycle control.cs will need two axis (maybe even three axis) motion built in for auto movement 

Machine.cs will need to have a facelift to be clearer and make it easier to have multiple machines 

Update to Pheripheral.cs to make it more variabled and easier to communicate between seperate cameras and what not

TODO:
1. Update existing files to take 2/3 dimensions
2. Build Experiment Builder classes and files
3. Implemnet to front end of development
