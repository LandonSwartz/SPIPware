Experiment Builder:

GOAL: To build 'experiments' in SPIPware and greatly expand the experiment function by making it variable

Steps:
1. Make classes for steps of experiment

Experiment
|
|--Plate (collection of wells)
|	|
|	|--Wells (each individual thing of being experimented)

Wells will need radius and other attributes
Plates will need number of wells and arrangement
Expriment will need number of plates and positioning

2. Make pop-up window of experiment builder
	- Want to make it savabale and reusable
	- variable
	- etc.
	
3. Implement and test
