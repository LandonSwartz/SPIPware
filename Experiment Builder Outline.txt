Experiment Builder:

GOAL: To build 'experiments' in SPIPware and greatly expand the experiment function by making it variable

Steps:
1. Make classes for steps of experiment

Experiment
|
|--Machine
|	|
|	|--Plate (collection of wells)
|	|	|
|	|	|--Wells (individual thing of being experimented
|	|	|


Wells will need radius and other attributes
Plates will need number of wells and arrangement
Machine will be a camera and number of plates
Expriment will need number of total plates and positioning and  number of machines/cameras connected

2. Make pop-up window of experiment builder
	- Want to make it savabale and reusable
	- variable
	- etc.
	
3. Implement and test
